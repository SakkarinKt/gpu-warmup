Relevant properties of this CUDA device
(X) Can overlap one CPU<>GPU data transfer with GPU kernel execution (device property "deviceOverlap")
(X) Can overlap two CPU<>GPU data transfers with GPU kernel execution
    (Compute Capability >= 2.0 AND (Tesla product OR Quadro 4000/5000/6000/K5000)

Measured timings (throughput):
 Memcpy host to device	: 1.370400 ms (12.242569 GB/s)
 Memcpy device to host	: 1.281696 ms (13.089856 GB/s)
 Kernel			: 0.057664 ms (2909.478383 GB/s)

Theoretical limits for speedup gained from overlapped data transfers:
No overlap at all (transfer-kernel-transfer): 2.709760 ms 
Compute can overlap with one transfer: 2.652096 ms
Compute can overlap with both data transfers: 1.370400 ms

Average measured timings over 10 repetitions:
 Avg. time when execution fully serialized	: 2.702643 ms
 Avg. time when overlapped using 4 streams	: 1.673421 ms
 Avg. speedup gained (serialized - overlapped)	: 1.029222 ms

Measured throughput:
 Fully serialized execution		: 12.415413 GB/s
 Overlapped using 4 streams		: 20.051402 GB/s
